# The Odin Project: Weather App

This is a minimalist weather app built using vanilla Javascript and the OpenWeather API. 

## Assignment
The original assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).

- [x] Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.
- [x] Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.
- [x] Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
- [x] Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
- [x] Display the information on your webpage!
- [x] Add any styling you like!
- [ ] Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.
- [x] Push that baby to github and share your solution below!

## Getting Started
Just head to the [app](rlpennell.github.io/weather/) and enter a zipcode.
